        <h1>Lesson 3: Deep Dive into Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Neural networks are fundamental in AI models. In this lesson, we'll explore the architecture and working principles of neural networks.</p>
    <p>Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.</p>
    <p>They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and produces an output signal.</p>
    <p>Neural networks can be trained using algorithms such as backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize their parameters and improve their performance.</p>
    <p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks).</p>
    <p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.</p>
    <p>Key components of neural networks include activation functions, which introduce non-linearity into the model, and loss functions, which measure the model's performance.</p>
    <p>Understanding neural networks is crucial for designing and implementing advanced AI models.</p>
    <p>In addition to the architecture and components of neural networks, we'll also explore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Training Techniques:</strong> Different approaches for training neural networks, such as mini-batch gradient descent, momentum, and adaptive learning rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularization:</strong> Techniques to prevent overfitting in neural networks, including L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Architectures:</strong> Overview of advanced neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Real-world applications of neural networks across various domains, including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and gaming.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By understanding these advanced concepts, you'll be equipped to tackle complex problems and develop cutting-edge AI solutions.</p>
